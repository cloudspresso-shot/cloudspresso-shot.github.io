Hello there! 

Welcome to the Cloudspresso Shot! 
My name is Arne, I am currently studying for a masterâ€˜s degree in business informatics and I am a big Cloud Computing enthusiast. 

I had my first contact with Cloud Computing during the writing of my bachelor thesis. Shortly afterwards, I became part of a small DevOps team, where I collected my first experiences with AWS, CloudFormation and Terraform. 
Since then I really was fasciniated about Cloud Computing and all the possibilities it brings with it. After working with AWS for a few months, I decided to take on the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification, which I successfully passed. 

I believe that sharing knowledge is one most important tasks in our life. If you share knowledge of topics that you are passionate about, you enable others to understand and learn much easier. Moreover, your own understanding of these topics will be increased. 

This is why I started this blog. My mission is to share knowledge about a topic which fascinates me - Cloud Computing. Not because I already know everything, but rather to share my journey on learning about this highly interesting field of computer science with you. 

In my next post, I will share with you the concept behind the Cloudspresso Shot blog and why this name fits perfectly to what I want to archive. See you soon! ðŸ˜„
